BotNet2 Change Settings & Bug Disclosure Policy
Purpose

BotNet2 is an experimental, open project that allows users to change and customize most system settings. This policy explains how these changeable settings work, the risks involved, and how bugs or security break points must be reported.

Change Settings Overview

BotNet2 is intentionally designed to allow broad user customization. Some settings may expose experimental or unfinished features. These settings are provided as-is and may change at any time.

If a specific setting causes repeated issues, security concerns, or a large number of user complaints, the developers reserve the right to modify or remove that setting without notice.

Security Notes

BotNet2 is actively improving security. Current protections include CAPTCHA on login, Google login support, and encrypted email storage to prevent public discovery.

The developers do not intentionally expose encrypted or sensitive user data. The only information that may be visible through normal browser behavior is standard site cookies.

No system is perfectly secure, and BotNet2 should be considered a work in progress.

Bug & Break Point Reporting

If you discover a bug, vulnerability, or break point related to changeable settings or any other part of BotNet2, you must report it immediately to the developers.

Please include clear details so the issue can be reproduced and fixed. Publicly exploiting, sharing, or abusing bugs or vulnerabilities is not allowed.

Reporting issues helps protect you and other users.

Responsible Use & Liability

By using BotNet2, you acknowledge that the project is under active development and that changeable settings may introduce risks.

Failure to report known vulnerabilities may put you and others at risk. The developers are not responsible for damage caused by unreported, abused, or intentionally exploited issues.

Policy Updates

This policy may be updated at any time as settings, features, and security improvements change. Features that generate excessive security concerns may be restricted or removed.

Contact

Bug reports and security concerns should be sent through the official BotNet2 project channels.
